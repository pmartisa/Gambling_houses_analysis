# Where are gambling houses located in Madrid?

As part of my Algorithms class at Columbia University, I decided to explore if a higher presence of gambling houses in some districts of Madrid (and the absence in others) could be related to other demographic variables such as median household income, number of people per household, migrant population, unemployment rate, etc. 

According to a prior statistical analysis (linear regression), the high prevalence of gambling houses in districts such as Carabanchel, Teutan or Puente de Vallecas seems to be corralated to a higher migrant population, which according to some experts is the target audience of these businesses.

I used this information to guide my story, as well as to create some interactive graphics that could better explain the drastic change Madrid have have lived in the last five years regarding the presence of betting centers, and who is being affected. 

<h5> Data used </h5>
The data used come from the [Census of business premises and their activities] (https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=66665cde99be2410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&), an open data portal that belongs to the Madrid City Council.

Other variables used in the exploratory analysis like median household income, percentage of migrant population, household size, etc. came from different official datasets gathered by the National Institute of Statistics (INE). 

Finally, I also used the library Scrollama to create one interactive bar chart, previously designed using Plotnine (Python) and Adobe Illustrator.
